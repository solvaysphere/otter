- remaining error todos
    - flag warnings if tu/@srclang does not match global decl
        - is there a way I can map this back to the TU?
    - multiple bpts with the same @i
    - Make sure that user's can't do thing like add <hi> tags 
      in invalid locations.
    - epts that precede bpts
- add a factory class that takes a XMLInputFactory?
    - means I would need to handle non-consolidated characters?
- segmentbuilder may not be needed
- document everything
    - Need to clearly document what contents each tag can take.
- allow for some filter to ignore certain properties
- refactor addContent() of Subflow, HighlightTag, and TUV
    - I might need to break out these into more type-specific 
      adders
- support ude elements
- my paired tags example includes @x on ept, which it doesn't support
- I think I need a way to discard TUs that are bogus

- SNAXUserException makes it very hard to throw real runtime exceptions
  because they are masked
