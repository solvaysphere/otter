- I also need an error handle model.
- Snax should also arguably support any event being passed to the 
    ElementHandler interface. DefaultElementHandler can expose just the 
    normal ones.
- support hashcode for tags
- throw errors when improper tags appear within other tags (requires
  registering element handlers)
- add a factory class that takes a XMLInputFactory?
    - means I would need to handle non-consolidated characters?
- i'm not supporting TU attributes at all
- TypedTag is redundant with StandaloneTag
