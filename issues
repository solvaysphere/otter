- remaining error todos
    - multiple bpts with the same @i
    - Make sure that user's can't do thing like add <hi> tags 
      in invalid locations.
- add a factory class that takes a XMLInputFactory?
    - means I would need to handle non-consolidated characters?
- segmentbuilder may not be needed
- document everything
- allow for some filter to ignore certain properties
- refactor addContent() of Subflow, HighlightTag, and TUV
    - I might need to break out these into more type-specific 
      adders
- various writer unittests
- need some sort of stringbuilder-y thing to simplify writing tuvs
  TUVBuilder basically
- writer should always write source language tuv first
- need a way to report errors when writing
    - eg what if we try to write a tu that doesn't include a tuv of the
      source locale.  is this a warning?  error?
- util code to serialize TUV data to something legible would be nice
