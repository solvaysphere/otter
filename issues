- This structure needs to be recursive.
    - It might be possible if I update snax to handle attaching other models
      directly.  But even them I think that only goes one level deep.
- I also need an error handle model.
- Snax should also arguably support any event being passed to the 
    ElementHandler interface. DefaultElementHandler can expose just the 
    normal ones.
