- I also need an error handle model.
- throw errors when improper tags appear within other tags (requires
  registering element handlers)
- add a factory class that takes a XMLInputFactory?
    - means I would need to handle non-consolidated characters?
- segmentbuilder may not be needed
- flag warnings if tu/@srclang does not match global decl
- switch TMXEvent* to TMXReader/TMXWriter
- document everything
- allow for some filter to ignore certain properties
