- remaining error todos
    - multiple bpts with the same @i
    - Make sure that user's can't do thing like add <hi> tags 
      in invalid locations.
- add a factory class that takes a XMLInputFactory?
    - means I would need to handle non-consolidated characters?
- segmentbuilder may not be needed
- document everything
- allow for some filter to ignore certain properties
- refactor addContent() of Subflow, HighlightTag, and TUV
    - I might need to break out these into more type-specific 
      adders
- various writer unittests
- writer should always write source language tuv first
- need a way to report errors when writing
    - eg what if we try to write a tu that doesn't include a tuv of the
      source locale.  is this a warning?  error?
- util code to serialize TUV data to something legible would be nice
- use xmlunit
- arguably TUVBuilder should only support build() at the top level, 
  nested builders shouldn't
    - this becomes tricky to implement because of the method chaining.
      if build() is in a subclass, the return value will be something
      that would need to be cast down in order to call it.
- writer needs to throw errors if you call things at the wrong time
- ensure order of parameters in tag constructors is consistent
- review some tag constructors, I think I may have too many (esp PlaceholderTag)
- what is the correct behavior of calling TUVBuilder.build() multiple times
- support other <note> attributes: o-encoding, xml:lang
- support other <property> attributes: xml:lang
